# Dice Game!

This dice game incorporates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses a random number generator to determine the dice winner every time the page is refreshed.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this game came from The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu. The Dice Challenge helped me be able to build it and then I went back and made changes to make the code more simple and styled it the way I wanted. 

## Installation
No installation is needed. The game can be accessed on the web.

## Usage
Refresh the page using the refresh icon or F5 on the keyboard to see if Player 1 or 2 wins or if it's a tie.
